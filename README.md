# k-means Clustering: 2D points

Implemented k-means algorithm to cluster a set of 1000 2D points. The data points (x,y) will be generated via Gaussian distribution.

- Implemented K-means algorithm to cluster generated points. K-means will take a set of points and number of clusters (K) to be formed and will cluster the points into given number of clusters. The algorithm will stop if there is no significant change coming in positions of centroids.
- Provided a graphical visualization of the process of formation of clusters.
- Ran K-means 10 times and gave the best clustering formation achieved. The criteria to assess quality of clusters is defined.
